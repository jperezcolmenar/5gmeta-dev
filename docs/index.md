## What does the 5GMETA platform do?

5GMETA Platform gives access to Third Parties to vehicle and road infrastructure data.
It can be seen as a meeting-point between CAM data producers and consumers. 
It allows the data producers (vehicles and RSUs) to post data from their data sources (e.g. sensors, camera) so that the data consumers can consume them in streaming mode in order to create data-driven innovative services for their clients. 
Streaming mode means that the 5GMETA platform doesnâ€™t store data.
